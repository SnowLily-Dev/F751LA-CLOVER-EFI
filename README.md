# F751LA-CLOVER-EFI
My Clover EFI folder for Asus F751LA laptops<br></br>
Important note: As far as I have tested this ONLY works and macOS Mojave as I am currently running the 10.14.6 update.<br></br>
DO NOT try to update to Catalina as I have experienced that this breaks Clover on the harddrive(in my case SSD) as well as the USB no matter if you use the internal updater or a Uni/Multibeast USB!<br></br>
Other note: As the Asus F751LAB is basically the same device with the only difference being that it shipped with Windows 10(I actually swapped out my old F751LAB motherboard for F751LA not knowing that it was an F751LA when my original motherboard broke and it is literally the exact same device) this should theoretically work perfectly on that that model as well. Though of course I can't be sure that it is the exact same in i.e. the firmware, so keep in mind that it isn't a given for this EFI backup to work an that device.<br></br>
